# Blueberry
Gnome extension for bluetooth battery indication

## Notes
Right now this extension is not configurable. I intend to implement configuration options in the near future, but, because this is my first Gnome extension, I am still in the learning process to do so.

Please report any issues and be vocal about any suggestions you may have on ways to improve this extension.

I have never seem a blueberry IRL, and I am not good at drawing.
